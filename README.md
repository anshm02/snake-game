This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++. The game allows you to control a snake and navigate it across the screen to eat food and grow longer. However, be careful not to collide with the walls or your own body, as that will result in game over.

Down Arrow: Move the snake downwards.
Left Arrow: Move the snake to the left.
Right Arrow: Move the snake to the right.
